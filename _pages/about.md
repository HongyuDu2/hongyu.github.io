I obtained the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Sichuan University and Master in Biostatistics from Duke University. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Biostatistics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. My research focuses on machine learning and complex data analysis, and I have multiple papers published or submitted to ICMLC, ICMA, Frontiers in Psychology, ICLR, and JCGS.

From undergraduate to PhD studies, I have made substantial contributions to machine learning and complex data analysis. In natural language processing, I developed a Chinese-language Fog Index, applying NLP techniques to assess the readability of Chinese financial reports. For recommendation algorithms, I created a tourism recommendation model based on collaborative filtering. In genetic data analysis, I designed a more precise algorithm for studying gene expression and guide RNA based on the 'BiasedUrn' approach. In the field of time series, I researched a decomposition framework based on LLM that balances global and component errors. My PhD research focuses on functional data analysis, where I integrate high-dimensional functional terms into the Cox model, achieving a 50-fold improvement in computational efficiency.

Currently, my research focuses on two main topics. The first is the study of Cox models with additive functional terms, and the second involves analyzing the distribution and structure of kidney cell images using machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for ICLR2025.
