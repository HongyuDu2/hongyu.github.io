I obtained the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Sichuan University and Master in Biostatistics from Duke University. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Biostatistics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. My research focuses on machine learning and functional data analysis, and I have multiple published papers and served as a reviewer for ICLR.

From undergraduate to PhD studies, I have made substantial contributions to machine learning and data analysis. In natural language processing, I developed a [Chinese-language Fog Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3395260.3395283?casa_token=JtSgDuOx34UAAAAA:ga8FGkSLvpZbgKvx4wej21u3B62w5gBRRQnPLhxq3hbylrCWQgfXJNRZa1ibWJu9TXWvmo7b5EZv), applying NLP techniques to assess the readability of Chinese financial reports. For recommendation algorithms, I created a [tourism recommendation model](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sizhe-Yu-2/publication/341658204_Improved_Tourism_Recommendation_System/links/61448dde519a1a381f6722e2/Improved-Tourism-Recommendation-System.pdf) based on collaborative filtering. In the analysis of cell image data, I performed cell segmentation and identification on 800 kidney cell images and examined the microenvironment using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In the field of time series, I researched a [decomposition framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11340?) based on LLM that balances global and component errors. My PhD thesis research focuses on functional data analysis, where I integrate high-dimensional functional terms into the Cox model, achieving a 50-fold improvement in computational efficiency.
