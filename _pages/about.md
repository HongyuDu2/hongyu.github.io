Welcome to my homepage! I am Hongyu Du, a PhD student at the School of Computer Science, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, under the supervision of Prof. Wenqiang Lei.

My research delves into the theoretical foundations of deep learning and machine learning. Furthermore, I'm exploring how tools from numerical optimization and natural language processing can be used to create a more reliable and robust scientific algorithm for addressing social issues.

Specifically, my research lies in the span of the following topics:
- Data Synthesis and Data Mining
- Alignment of Large Language Models
- Applications of Large Language Models in Legal, Medical, and Financial Industries
